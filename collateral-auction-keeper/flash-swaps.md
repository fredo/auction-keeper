# Collateral Auction Flash Swaps

## Overview

Normally, the collateral auction-keeper uses RAI to bid on fixed discount collateral auctions. A keeper operator must acquire RAI and also maintain a RAI balance in the collateral keeper to be prepared for future collateral auctions. With collateral auction flash swaps, this is no longer necessary.

The auction-keeper can be configured to use Uniswap flash swaps when bidding on collateral auctions. This allows the keeper to participate in collateral auctions with no upfront capital\(ether or RAI\) other than gas costs.

## Details

The collateral auction-keeper performs flash swaps with a single tx through the [geb-keeper-flash-proxy](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-keeper-flash-proxy) contracts.

The _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_ is used by _auction-keeper_ to:

1\) liquidate a critical SAFE\(starting an auction\) and bid on the _new_ auction by calling `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_

or

2\) bid on _existing_ auctions by calling `settleAuction` on _geb-keeper-flash-proxy_

## Uniswap RAI pools currently supported by keeper for flash swaps

[dai-v3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xcb0c5d9d92f4f2f80cce7aa271a1e148c226e19d)

[eth-v2](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x8ae720a71622e824f576b4a8c03031066548a3b1)

[usdc-v3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xfa7d7a0858a45c1b3b7238522a0c0d123900c118)

[eth-v3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x14de8287adc90f0f95bf567c0707670de52e3813)

## Configuration

How to enable:  use `--flash-swaps` flag when starting a collateral auction-keeper

Specify a pool order: use `--flash-swap-pools` flag.  eg. `--flash-swap-pools eth-v2, dai-v3, usdc-v3, eth-v3`

The default order is `dai-v3, eth-v2, usdc-v3, eth-v3`

## Flash Swaps in Action

Below is log output from _auction-keeper_ started with `--flash-swap` and  `--flash-swap-pools usdc-v3,dai-v3,eth-v2,eth-v3`

First, the _auction-keeper_ finds a critical SAFE and successfully calls `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` using the usdc-v3 flash proxy.
The _auction-keeper_ finds another critical SAFE and tries to call `liquidateAndSettleSAFE` using the usdc-v3 flash proxy again. 
As this is a much larger SAFE, this call fails due to lack of liquidity in rai-usdc-v3 pool. The _auction-keeper_ then successfully uses the dai-v3 flash-proxy to liquidate this SAFE.

Finally, the _auction-keeper_ finds a third ciritcal SAFE and successfully uses usdc-v3 flash proxy to `liquidateAndSettleSAFE`

## Caveats

* Flash swaps are only supported for collateral auctions.
* _auction-keeper_ will not do flash swaps on critical SAFEs with saviours. [Read more about saviours](https://docs.reflexer.finance/integrations/safe-insurance)

## Possible errors

When liquidity is too low, the calls to the flash proxys will revert *or* run out of gas. In this case, the _auction-keeper_ will attempt the next uniswap pool in order.
In the unlikely case all call fails(none of the pools have enough liquidity), the auction-keeper can be restarted without `--flash-swap` to bid normally with the keeperâ€™s system coin.
